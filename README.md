# Mad Libber

This project uses the tutorial at https://github.com/jumbosushi/chrome-extension-tutorial as the basis of its project. We are grateful and indebted to the work of Atsushi Yamamoto.

#### About
This is a Chrome extension which will create a MadLib out of any webpage.

In order to install the extension to Google Chrome, download this project and visit chrome://extensions

Then, enable Developer Mode and select "Load unpacked extension"

Select the folder containing this project's files. And you should see the MadLib icon appear in your browser.

Enjoy!

#### What we learned:
- How to write a very basic Chrome extension
- Practice pulling and modifying HTML elements from webpages
- Practice working with APIs/HTTP requests

#### What didn't work
- Word replacement lacks context-- many English words can be different parts of speech depending on context
- Given more time, we would want to add editable textfields, rather than just noun/verb/adj labels
